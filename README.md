# Cross-The-Road  game
There is a busy road of a few lanes with cars rushing randomly.Each time player crosses the road,score increses and he comes back to the start state.
difficulty level increases level wise after reaching a given score.
   I have applied concepts of OOPs,pointers and Data structures to code this game in c++.
